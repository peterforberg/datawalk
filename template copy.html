       <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="overview">
        <div class="finding1">Shared purpose motivates aligning efforts.</div>
        <div class="finding2">ACHs can facilitate aligning by building shared purpose across sectors and geographic boundaries.</div>
        <div class="finding3">Shared purpose is measured here by survey respondent’s understanding of and commitment to the ACH’s vision, but it could also relate to smaller objectives like project or program outcomes.</div>
        <div class="finding1">Agreeing on an ACH’s shared purpose can be particularly challenging when the ACH serves racially, ethnically, or geographically diverse communities.</div>
        <div class="finding2">Almost all survey respondents said they were committed to their ACH’s vision but fewer said they could describe the vision and even fewer said they could describe how their ACH’s vision would be achieved.</div>
        <div class="finding3">Shared purpose was most strongly influenced by perceived effectiveness, power dynamics, and financing. For every unit increase in these indicators, shared purpose also increased.</div>
